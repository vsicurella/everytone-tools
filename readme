# Everytone Tools

This started out as a workspace to learn how to calculate the harmonic entropy model. 
I'm having fun exploring some different ideas and making visualizations of them so I'm not totally
sure what this might turn into but generally will stick to casual harmony analysis stuff. Hopefully
some musical or sound design projects will branch out of things explored here.
